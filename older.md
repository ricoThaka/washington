[The Moon - Clementine](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/clm_usgs_17.html) Clementine was a joint project between the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization and NASA. The objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos. The observations included imaging at various wavelengths including ultraviolet and infrared, laser ranging altimetry, and charged particle measurements. These observations were originally for the purposes of assessing the surface mineralogy of the Moon and Geographos, obtaining lunar altimetry from 60N to 60S latitude, and determining the size, shape, rotational characteristics, surface properties, and cratering statistics of Geographos.
Clementine was launched on 25 January 1994 at 16:34 UTC (12:34 PM EDT) from Vandenberg AFB aboard a Titan IIG rocket. After two Earth flybys, lunar insertion was achieved on February 21. Lunar mapping took place over approximately two months, in two parts. The first part consisted of a 5 hour elliptical polar orbit with a perilune of about 400 km at 28 degrees S latitude. After one month of mapping the orbit was rotated to a perilune of 29 degrees N latitude, where it remained for one more month. This allowed global imaging as well as altimetry coverage from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N.

i had a good thing going with [nth-child floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child). [@sawmac thanks!] Every other image is either left or right justified. Each timne i upload a photo the layout changes bc images get shifted to the opposite side of the screen. I know im communicating well at times and the variety will help at least in my theroy not be as challenging to revisit for those that need to look at research/interest/ activity record. This is my first try at nested css. i just [started updating my CV](ricothaka.github.io/cv) and the Nested array concept i learned in `ruby` seems to be common thing in programming if u consider any array of items this one is unexpected bc it will always grow the array is whats displayed on screen

## Deimos Eclipse
Deimos is the smaller of Mars' two moons. It's 9 by 7 by 6.8 miles in size (15 by 12 by 11 kilometers). Deimos orbits Mars every 30 hours.Deimos was discovered on Aug. 11, 1877 by Asaph Hall. Hall named Mars' moons for the mythological sons of Ares, the Greek counterpart of the Roman god, Mars. Deimos, whose name means dread, is the brother of Phobos.

[Intro]
So everyones been wondering why
Kash Doll's been rapping on everyone else beats
And why she's been riding other people waves
And, um, why she's killing all these remixes?
It's because I can't put my own original music out, okay?
It's because I signed myself in a hoe ass contract
I did that and now I'm trapped inside of a fucking dollhouse
And I wanna get out of this shit
No way to escape the dollhouse
But you know what?
Timing is everything and I think God has perfect timing
So right now, I'm just gonna get on every fucking beat there is
{% endhighlight %}

[January 6 U.S. Capitol attack riot, Washington, D.C., U.S. [2021]](https://www.britannica.com/event/January-6-U-S-Capitol-attack) January 6 U.S. Capitol attack, storming of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, by a mob of supporters of Republican Pres. Donald J. Trump. The attack disrupted a joint session of Congress convened to certify the results of the presidential election of 2020, which Trump had lost to his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. Because its object was to prevent a legitimate president-elect from assuming office, the attack was widely regarded as an insurrection or attempted coup d’état. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law-enforcement agencies also considered it an act of domestic terrorism. For having given a speech before the attack in which he encouraged a large crowd of his supporters near the White House to march to the Capitol and violently resist Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory—which many in the crowd then did—Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives for “incitement of insurrection” (he was subsequently acquitted by the Senate).

{% highlight ruby %} 
[Verse]
Look, I be exploring the foreigns with more power than stars
On my new new shit, like my name is Rashaad
And my punchlines seasoned plenty minds like it's time
So, if he ever tell you he ain't feelin' me, he lying'
Shout out to me, all on BET
I'm a very rich chick, on my Nene Leakes
I'm a boss, every move gotta come through me
Murder broads in my minks
May they rest in peace
And I'm still the top chick
Any bitch think I drop dick get higher than Mariah
And she like a five octave
Stop it, please stop it
Blowing money
All in Neiman's in there Diddy bopping
And you know I came to murder it
My city watchin'
I'm so humble, I'ma front like I don't do this often
It's Kash Doll, bow down, and kiss the ring
Soon as this paperwork done
I'm touching everything
A murder scene

[Outro]
Haha
Yeah, that way
The doll way

The acronym was first used in the late 1980s by the British government's Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) when it documented and distributed dozens of best practices in IT service management.

[Neutron Imaging](https://www.iaea.org/topics/neutron-imaging#:~:text=Neutron%20imaging%20is%20a%20non,composition%20or%20its%20geometrical%20form.) is a non-destructive technique for analysing the structure of a sample. based on the same principles as X ray imaging but neutrons interact with the atoms' nuclei rather than with their electrons. Contrary to X rays, however, neutrons are also attenuated by some light materials, such as hydrogen, carbon, boron and lithium, and penetrate many heavy materials, such as titanium and lead. This characteristic gives neutron imaging an advantage over X ray imaging when it comes to 2D and 3D visualizations.

[The U.S. Space Force](https://www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/) was established on Dec. 20, 2019, creating the first new branch of the armed services since 1947. The establishment of the USSF resulted from widespread recognition that space is a national security imperative. When combined with the growing threat posed by strategic competitors in space, it became clear that there was a need for a military service focused solely on pursuing superiority in the space domain.

- [I-Team Report from Sen Ossoff blasts DFCS over child deaths, sex trafficking - FOX5Atlanta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG5lNgLgJTo) ATLANTA - U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff has released a scathing report on Georgia's child welfare agency, saying systemic failures have allowed kids to die and that hundreds of children have been sex trafficked while under state care. The report also takes aim at Gov. Brian Kemp's appointed director of the Division of Family and Children Services, accusing her of trying to hide the extent of problems.

Its [Rashard Iman Kelly](https://github.com/ricoThaka/rashardmro/blob/master/README.md). I was a Jehovahs Witness in Decatur. And when I was a kid my Uncle was a Savannah Businessman named Clarence MAxwell. He had Season Tickets to the Falcons and he gave me a job driving to atlanta for him when i was 14. So I was interested in Graffiti bc my mom was a Playboy Bunny aka PRostitute in NewYork and an Architecht the Jons make them girls do a lot. I am in a relationship with the Magcicity Dancer Normani sometimes she is Megan Thee Stallion or KASHDOLL. We used to work at Rentpath together and our relationship while there is sexuality we are/were seeking exclusive companionship. I know she came to my motherinlaw house in dark makeup bc she went on a date with me after my JehovahWitness wife Erika aka LAtto of LAttoCity dumped me in the cold Decatur winter leaving me with sore stinging frost bitten hands. We were bigtime youngpeople in Jehovahs witnesses i was a Ministerial Servant which in traditional Christianity is a Decon. I work for NASAJPL now. The energy is now being used properly. I bring up Normani/Kashdoll bc since she picked up My kid of DFACS that was my contact and we are peers! Long Before at Dance411 on Moreland we got involved and she said she had to work towards me. She work for Playboy and wanna/wanted to settle down. I can go into my relationship details another day. Sen.

She would give me time, and on Aug13 i followed her like a duck at her request, and it went down that night... My life fell apart! She is a Playboy bunny and i started getting bullied and sexually harassed at work! I got funneled out to Los Angeles and Mental HEalth= [The Third Reich](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/third-reich)! so its easy to get lost. Normani and LAtto are manipulating familiy relationships an tech to keep me here.

I know since i have these sound issues at the library, people had to gossip! I remember i went through that phase wearing my headphones all the time. And giggling in The NASA_JUNO Commander face while 2Pac was playing bc of how he act! But i had to be disciplined after that day. He did not say anything. I just realized i did ![Walkman Era](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Walkman_logo_%282000%29.svg/1024px-Walkman_logo_%282000%29.svg.png) Society SHutout and was falling behind socially in some areas at work. I needed the music at the time at that magnitude bc the pop music catalog. Like the shit u buy from packaged retailers, even underground spots like [FatBeats](https://www.sandboxautomatic.com/) is a catalog of a history thats in your area. Like 2pac life choices impact me and Tick_A_LOT act like him in Hollywood an he act like Erika Daddy Kevin, so i have to hear all the records. But there is a setting and pacing so you dont fall behind and miss important meeting notes. I would have understood how JunoCam could have protected my family if i could understand his urgency!

It's a way to shorten the length of the critical rendering path, which translates into reduced page load times. 
`loading` Indicates when the browser should load the iframe:
> `eager` Load the iframe immediately on page load (this is the default value).
> `lazy` Defer loading of the iframe until it reaches a calculated distance from the visual viewport, as defined by the browser. The intent is to avoid using the network and storage bandwidth required to fetch the frame until the browser is reasonably certain that it will be needed. This improves the performance and cost in most typical use cases, in particular by reducing initial page load times. - [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) [Why shouldn't lazy-loaded iframes preload? #2352](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/2352) [HTML - Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html)

# Four Views of Mars in Northern Summer
Four faces of Mars as seen on March 30, 1997 are presented in this montage of NASA Hubble Space Telescope images. Proceeding in the order upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right, Mars has rotated about ninety degrees between each successive time step. For example the Tharsis volcanoes, which are seen (between 7:30 and 9 o'clock positions) in mid-morning in the UPPER-RIGHT view, are seen near the late afternoon edge of the planet (about 3 o'clock position) in the lower-left image. All of these color images are composed of individual red (673 nanometers), green (502 nm), and blue (410 nm) Planetary Camera exposures.[ReadMore at NAsa PhotoJournal (NasaJPL)](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01248)

The mast head contains the SuperCam instrument (its lens is in the large circular opening). In the gray boxes beneath mast head are the two Mastcam-Z imagers. On the exterior sides of those imagers are the rover's two navigation cameras.

# Dear Mro

Jamie Mantel/SenBillNelSon,

I dont know if you are still alive(jamie). I went to the Team Meeting for the Ecostress Instrument and got removed by Hotel Faculty! I went ontime and everythign! The people did not defend me. IDK what is p with the country bc im scared. I lost Coral! and Erika is  [Prosituted in Los Angeles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAOwmcdLvek) well sold for, she was always sensitive intimately so i know she wanted to go someplace where she felt stable psychologically. I was supposed to go to Arcadia for a court date. During Covid Lockdown. After Erika dumped me, i made friends with a girl after [Muna Ahmed died](https://www.wagesfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Muna-Ahmed/obituary). [Normani](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/normani-kordei-cyber-bullied-twitter) she was of age we went on a [date](https://honeybubbletea.kwickmenu.com/). I was on Instagram as ClarkGabl3 but changed the screename to DeeLoveBomr bc i was wrioting graffiti an the word `LOVER` and did not think Clark Gable real life should be mixed up with mine at all! So I asked Dr_Pirrat if she wrote graffiti. Bc all the young ppl at JPL have this life online, its strange, I got excluded from my demographic bc i had a child. Now i cant mingle and hanging out with you old people dont seem to be doing much but getting me hurt like them strippers. U cant be close to every one, i work with you, and i put my hannds on that girl [Normani](https://www.tiktok.com/@normani?lang=en) and there is a huge population in Atlanta that will freak the fuck out! If I leave her alone inLos Angeles! I want to work and be acknowledged! im about to miss my meal.. I will write mre later. I want to hear the discourses on EcoStress so bad. But its just [BadTiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i77qbwimO1w)

### Dear Rep/Mayor Karen,
I signed up for a class that [NASAJPL](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) is offering at [CourtYard by Marriot Pasadena](https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/courtyard-los-angeles-pasadena-monrovia.html). As you can see in the [LAPD DETAinMENT on METROLA PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricoThaka/ricothaka.github.io/pixelsquare/assets/pdf/image.pdf), I was accused of Tresspassing. I i dont know what i need to do to use the transit system safely. LAPD is pushing [FareEnforcement](https://abc7.com/post/metro-safety-stopping-fare-evaders-seen-key-preventing-crime/15054806/) but are not making exceptions. If you look at the graphic below in my [GMAiL_EMAiL_iNBOX](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXd4idMbwAUqOMQ?format=jpg&name=large) you will see that Los Angeles Police never emailed me back after i was victim of that Armed Gunman at CityHAll with the Playboy Backpack on, so this Tap card thing. I see people at Saint Francis with MailBoxes and There is this place in Santa Monica that offer mailboxes, but im in a different situation since i was Abandoned. I took a shower at [Reality_LA](https://realityla.com/), AND I KNOW The Medicated Shampoo and Terry Cloth towel Pulled out at least 200 bugs! The Larve breask my hair down and it just cracks off while Dry Scapl tortures me with itching and burning. Please send a team from NasaJPL to talk to them about what [Entomological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_warfare#:~:text=EW%20is%20a%20specific%20type,the%20insects%20over%20target%20areas.) looks like in [Los Angeles ](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA530979.pdf).

So I want to make sure i can make the [ECOSTRESS Science and Application Team Meeting - Fall 2024](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/events/ecostress-science-and-application-team-meeting-fall-2024) meeting and start making more progress on getting my badge back. Whereever my daughter is, Erika, and the dancing girls... Id dont matter! I have to be badged. [A California driver’s license](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/driver-licenses-dl/) used to be easy to renew.

[HollywoodFoodCo](https://hofoco.org/) have raffles fo id_vouchers.

[Among the Peaks of Hale Crater](https://www.uahirise.org/hipod/ESP_075380_1440)
This observation was requested as part of a new monitoring sequence, to try to get activity after a dust storm to compare with a previous sequence. Are the recurring slope lineae longer or more dense? Hale was created by an impactor roughly 35 kilometers (22 mi) across that impacted at an oblique angle about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.

## Twin of NASA’s Perseverance Mars Rover Begins Terrain Tests

![Optimism](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipia24525-e1-1041.jpg)

Jamie, I am getting confused. The person that put me down is a firefighter too and put me down there. Is there like some sort of equipment Flow Control? Bc [Optimism](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/twin-of-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover-begins-terrain-tests/)... I cant remember but I know He is going to talk to me soon, and I need to be ready Ms Bass! 
`Updated with new features, including additional mobility software and the bulk of the sample caching system, the twin of NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover arrives at JPL’s Mars Yard garage on Oct. 29, 2021. Called OPTIMISM, the vehicle is used for testing commands before they are sent to Mars.`


## Code Refactoring
Good Afternoon MRO. 
Dear Chris, i know you were a Mori Person as well but older and i was brought on like TekSystems so i was mision right away. I remember ppl were talking about using Salt for configuration Management and there is the inhouse system. I mean it all seems attached to the Netapp and that Refurb that happened in the Mission Control Datacenter. I was Told there was cracks in the floor and i thought you all were Mean military people. I was in my head lashing out at my marriage and religious way of life collapsing and worried aobut being chased off. Thanks. BTW i did not recall the rover is Nuclear Powered!

I really enjoyed this section from [Steve Lindstorm](https://dontpaniclabs.com/blog/post/2020/11/11/reflections-on-css-refactoring-by-steve-lindstrom/)

Now i dont know what standards exist if any but this is the type of information i shared with the girls my age from Dance411. The problem is they was teaching a lot of criiminal men and they infiltrated corporate and really hurt atlanta. I was talking to her independantyly and teaching her middleware bc thats where she was getting knixed online. The thing is with the Striptease they have to balance functioning in the daytime affter a nighttime kidnapping and rape. Im not saying every guy that has been in her company is bad. But she has been asking me for a child for about 5 years now. Im afraid and bleeding.

# Cydonia to Watts?
Dear Nicky,

I skipped ahead... I was sitting in [Saint_Francis](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GWU8mdlbQAUEeSF?format=png&name=4096x4096) and i felt insecure, u know people are funny about Mars Research, The Metaphysics have abused ppl sexualy for years. I love how the images remove the fear that i am being strange. So [The Draw Of Cydonia](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Cydonia_s_Face_on_Mars_in_3D_animation) you describe the [Design of the Tesla Coil ](https://www.teslacoildesign.com/), well not  the [design](https://archive.org/details/Giant_Robot_Volume_1_The_Night_the_Earth_Stood_Still), but you mention [Wardenclyff Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower) which look like [Dalek](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/doctor-who-aliens/) kinda... i might be [looking up the wrong thing](https://archive.org/details/giant-robo-collection-1) but the structure is reminicent of the [Watts Towers in Los Angeles County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Towers) `33°56′19.46″N 118°14′27.77″W` While iot may be my DNS everything i find about them is that its an Art installations... `"Wireless Radio Station"` thats what got my attention! I have been getting online relationships organized and [Normani](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/dsn) is learning about the Facility. I have to get her clean from all that fraud working at [MagicCity](https://youtu.be/0dtGIjbe0r0?si=W5ESksjUFE63jQ2U) that place is such a burden. Anyway since u mention  [Wardenclyff Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIR7tcS5d8A) I want to talk to someone at work but they dont know alot but everything. I hate that they use vendor supplies, we should be all solaris if we wanna mason that shit, freebsd if we wanna tribal that shit
## this is an old post
I was at [Griffith](https://griffithobservatory.org/about/observatory-history/) and took some video Flikr Tourist style with my peice of shit ObamaPhone but the shits work, maybe watts towers was delivering wireless energy! Ile Los Angeles `Electric Avenue` has deeper meaning than we think. I know u get hit with [Electronic Weapons](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/sea/electronic-warfare?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=fy23framework&utm_medium=kw&utm_audience=list_g&utm_content=null_null&utm_format=copy&utm_code=OTH-13321&source=OTH-13321&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_sq2BhCUARIsAIVqmQs8sUIlvaJrzgE4ryeNoT45s4sopTlVVxUisXE0eERLyPZpRz7S8o8aAvmhEALw_wcB) but check it out the old Batman, its on the [homepage](ricothaka.github.io) but [u can have all the files](https://archive.org/download/batman-1943-episode-01) and its based in losangeles and the criminals fight with tasers this is the 1940s, what did Retail disrupt ?  
### [Tesla Coils at Griffith Observatory video](https://griffithobservatory.org/) 

[Tesla coil is an electrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891.[1] It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity.[2][3] Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.

## [HiView Image Viewer - Software](https://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/software/HiView/download.php)

### WHAT HiView DOES
HiView is a data explorer and image viewing application supporting the [JPEG2000](https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/) image format ![HiVeiw](https://www.uahirise.org/hiview/images/main-splash-screen.jpg) HiView is the best way to explore HiRISE images of the Martian surface at the full resolution of the imagery. Tracks of boulders that have fallen down crater walls, delicate rays of ejecta from fresh impact craters, and the unearthly formations created by carbon dioxide ice on the Martian south pole are just a few of the things that are waiting to be discovered by anyone using a tool like HiView with HiRISE imagery.

Dear_KevinRothwell idk whats going on with my life but im living in Los Angeles right now. You fired me. Do you have ties to [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117803?) because [Raising Dion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_Dion) is an embellished copy of my life with Coral! Theres a Gender swap. And she is a graphic designer, those girls from Dance411 know me that way i was hired as an inter webdeveloper probono an its like Willow Smith or Chloe Bailey from Rentpath Graphic Design... Well maybe thats not you [yallywood](https://www.wsj.com/story/welcome-to-yallywood-atlanta-is-now-the-hot-spot-for-celebrity-home-buyers-aa98768b). But I know Gary Powers was into [Korean Girls](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/08/asia/north-korean-refugees-trafficked-china-intl-hnk-dst/index.html) so I dont know your [value system](https://typeset.io/questions/what-is-the-conceptual-definition-of-value-systems-2nacjv2xlr). But there is a girl at CNN that i am angry at because I work for nasajpl i just am in a labor dispute after being poisoned thats all. Jeff told me he worked for JPL in the past so I thoughtI was in the right place. Ashley is related to you one way or another. There aer images posted from Curiosity and I was doing research my blog is popular back east and so is CNN. I was doing Geology on Mars and all the places [I need to explore  ](https://murray-lab.caltech.edu/) are on that map so its not like she stole something i cooked from scratch and im new to the world of research. So to be honest im confused. But Nakesha held me down for sex and i was all ready digging her so its toxic but not in terms of her control over my physical being and mind... She works at Magic City an they out here in Losangeles dancing at a the place from [Demi Moore movie  sHOWGIRLS](https://archive.org/details/showgirls-tv-version) I yelled at you to get away from me bc u dont realize you not my daddy, that was nasty an Mike Child a villian in the AJC...

# [The ALH 84001 Controversy ](https://astronomyonline.org/Astrobiology/ALH84001.asp)


The SNC-meteorites are a group of Achondrite meteorites, by them is assumed, that they originate from the Mars.
Shergottite meteorites are often made of mineral grains that can't be seen clearly without a microscope. The brown areas are grains of the mineral pyroxene and the clear white areas are the mineral plagioclase. These are the two most abundant minerals in a mafic magma of the Earth...[ReadMore](https://www.b14643.de/SNC-Meteorites/) [LEW88516 – 13.2 grams Lherzolitic Shergottite](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/mmc/lew88516.pdf)

### MARS METEORITE ALH 84001
Date: 05 April 2001
Copyright: NASA/JSC

This Martian meteorite is thought by some scientists to contain evidence of life on Mars. The rock is designated ALH84001, after the Allan Hills in Antarctica where it was found. [EuropeanSpaceAgency](https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/26756-mars-meteorite-alh-84001)

### Terrestrial Age
The “terrestrial age” of a meteorite is how long ago the meteorite fell to Earth. If people witnessed the meteorite’s fall, then its terrestrial age is obvious. But most meteorites, and all Antarctic meteorites like ALH 84001, fell without being noticed by people. Fortunately, terrestrial ages of meteorites can also be calculated from the abundances of some naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of chemical elements. These radioactive isotopes are formed in a meteorite, in space, as it is bombarded by cosmic rays (high-energy elementary particles). After a meteorite lands on Earth, it isn’t hit by cosmic rays any more, no more of the radioactive isotopes form, and the ones already in the rock continue decaying away. So, the more of these isotopes in a meteorite, the less time it has spent on Earth. Terrestrial ages are usually determined from isotopes of the elements carbon (14C), beryllium (10Be), and chlorine (36Cl).

The best measure of ALH 84001’s terrestrial age comes from its abundance of carbon-14 (14C). Carbon-14 dating is most commonly used to get ages for things like archaeological artifacts and the Shroud of Turin. The abundance of carbon-14 in ALH 84001 gives a terrestrial age of about 13,000 years [(Jull et al., 1995)](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/meteorites/ALH84001_References.html#JUL95).

![ALH84001](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lpi/meteorites/metonice.gif)
The National Science Foundation (U.S.) sponsors meteorite-collecting expeditions to Antarctica nearly every year. Meteorites are not abundant anywhere on Earth, but are easier to find in Antarctica than elsewhere on Earth. It’s easy to see black meteorites on the white ice. Also, meteorites that fall onto the Antarctic ice are frozen and preserved much better than they would be anywhere else on Earth. Photo c/o Ursula Marvin, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. ALH 84001 was found in Antarctica during the 1984-1985 Antarctic summer. It was found by a team of meteorite hunters from the ANSMET program, which is sponsored by the Polar Programs Office of the U.S. National Science Foundation. ANSMET stands for ANtarctic Search for METeorites, and has been funded since 1977 by the NSF. In that time, ANSMET meteorite hunters have found more than 7000 meteorites, almost triple the number known from outside Antarctica. The Antarctic Meteorite Location and Mapping Project (AMLAMP) provides locations, maps, and databases of meteorite finds.

### Fossil Life in ALH 84001?
>These pages are an explanation of the Science paper of Dr. David McKay and his co-workers, where they give evidence that martian bacteria may have lived in the martian meteorite ALH 84001. I’ve tried to organize and review their evidence that ALH 84001 contains fossils and traces of ancient martian life, and also tried to outline some counter-evidence and some likely questions about the evidence. My intention is to present the work of McKay and co-authors even-handedly and nonjudgmentally.

So now i understand that for the Pornography mob to take a family they havce to disable the breadwinner. Erika suggested we live outside, but that was a set up to dump me and i held on to the child as long as possible taking remote, devops and any position that would get me to the next meal with the kid and whatever i needed to keep her mother from running out in front of a car (YuppieSex). So The brown girl in the photo looks like #Muna_Ahmed from atlanta it could be Normani but we had a serious sexual relationship in georgia and she wanted to grow with a stable partner. And Coral was not a blacck Eye for a relationship bc She was happy and had dreadlocks the brown girls were from Africa so they loved me as a father and wanted to have a baby and We just continue. Then Muna died and Normani stepped in as Sartu at Muna funeral. I ended up back in California after someone saw Normani or Muna leave my East Atlanta Cottage (631 moreland ave) my life fell apart. Dwayne_Gooden of IonicSecurity and [USMC](https://www.marines.mil/) Started bullying me and saying Ethiopian girls are hard to get. He brought me in his office to talk about nightlife an i was questioned on "fuckinBitchiz" its a foriegn concept bc those prostitutes aka groupies are like stage children in regular population and being a JehovahsWitness stage child im a quick go to after they done murdered some pimp or something! And I want a peacful life. The guys that buy them for sex often molest children or turn a blind eye to it, so what do I do? i never bought anyone for sex or raped or even took advantage of anyone, maybe erika a little bit bc deepdown i knew we were just friends... But about the amout of women, they always comhome after they get a free break [MagicCity](https://www.magiccity.com/) dont talk about what they do to local men to perform... its dark, i want to work and earn money please help me

Hi Jamie/Robin/Brenda
  During my last time with you on campus i was told to explore the wheels! I guess you guys Saw my research to build a high powered grocery getter. I found this hole in the wheel about two months ago. The girls are really going through it right now and I really dont know what the future holds, but im dedicated to the mission. Jose Pi did not know i was real. I slap myself for running off when he said you cant come back. I learned a lot about working remote in Atlanta but i got fired twice bc i was having too much fun! I was completing tasks and training thier employees! PearsonEdu had a bunch of Windows admins and i tought them a lot of LinuxBased #DNS philosophy next thing you know im working remote and i have no income! If you are not in a office position ppl stop trusting you. I never knew my coworkeds went to MagicCity its a dark neighborhood secret and as we got older i aged out of the computer world in the east bc Normani got famous in BallroomDanceing and numbed the sex servant side to the eyes of the Public. Once i was seen with her it got really hard at work, I had no idea so much sabotage exisited. We got involved also be i was working 24.7 oncall "MissionCritical" support for Web.com and Ionic Security i saved them from Splunk issues so many times at night. I understand sleepcycles bc she became my friend. Im OnCall for them so "Be oncall for me" It was a freindship gesture. Now im friends with a sex slave, thats attracted to me!

<p>This image, taken in the Spacecraft Assembly Facility's High Bay 1 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on July 23, 2019, shows a close-up of the head of Mars 2020's remote sensing mast. The mast head contains the SuperCam instrument (its lens is in the large circular opening). In the gray boxes beneath mast head are the two Mastcam-Z imagers. On the exterior sides of those imagers are the rover's two navigation cameras.

[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Launches](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia04141-mars-reconnaissance-orbiter-mro-launches/) 
NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) launches at 7:43 a.m. EDT atop a Lockheed Martin Atlas V rocket from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Aug. 12. All systems performed nominally for NASA's first Atlas V launch. The spacecraft will arrive at Mars in March 2006. Once in orbit around Mars, various instruments on the MRO will convey detailed observations of the Martian surface, subsurface and atmosphere. Researchers will use the data to study the history and distribution of Martian water.

I have not really connected to any of your songs before, but today is different. I miss riding in [Savannah](https://visitsavannah.com/). I lost my little girl, the one that was with me when you an your girl pulled up on me in Savannah. That song was really healing. Im in Los Angeles, i got intimate with [Normani](https://variety.com/2024/music/news/normani-dopamine-debut-solo-album-1235918512/) and i dont know what life is, but i saw that LenoxMall tape when [Allied](https://www.aus.com/) tried you. They had this Intership program at Dance411 an a few girls encircled me, we went to Graveyard and HodgePodge for meetings, an after some reondevus with about 4 different girls that all wear the same makeup i realized i got played... There is this lightskinone i see in Hollywood hellafly, used to dance there... Anyway Im running bc i was accused of killing erika and ppl trying to kill me bc the charge cant stick! [Nasa](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) has been monitoring me an i know i can get clear! If you stuck in LosAngeles go get a BackgroundCheck its [FortMcFphereson](https://militarybases.com/georgia/fort-mcpherson/) for LA bc im getting taht since im criminally clean they putting a lot of pressure on me to stay healthy so they can come home.
